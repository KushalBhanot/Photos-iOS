# Photos-iOS

Was curious how Netflix and Spotify apps displayed content that can be scrolled horizontally and vertically with custom width and layout, and *CollectionViews* is the answer!

Ended up making a view similar to iOS' albums, take a look!

Classes used: 
- UICollectionViewDelegate
- UICollectionViewDataSource
- UICollectionViewDelegateFlowLayout

PS: Trying clicking on a cell and you'll see a change ðŸª„

ToDo: Implement a HeaderView
